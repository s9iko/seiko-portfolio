## Overview

A robust desktop inventory management system built with Windows Forms and .NET Framework that demonstrates fundamental database-driven application development principles. This application enables users to efficiently manage product inventory with full CRUD operations, advanced search capabilities, and comprehensive data validation.

## Key Features

**Product Management:**
- **CRUD Operations**: Add, update, and delete products with complete product details including name, quantity, price, supplier, and order date.
- **Product Details Capture**: Comprehensive information collection for full inventory tracking and supplier management.
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Intelligent checking for existing products before insertion to avoid data redundancy.

**Advanced Search & Filtering:**
- **Multi-Criteria Filtering**: Filter products by supplier, date range, price range, and total amount simultaneously.
- **Dynamic Search**: Real-time filtering capabilities for quick product lookup and analysis.

**Data Integrity & Validation:**
- **Input Validation**: Enforces integer validation for quantity fields and decimal validation for price fields.
- **Type Safety**: Ensures data consistency and prevents invalid entries from corrupting the database.
- **Dynamic Calculations**: Automatically computes total amount (Quantity × Price) for inventory valuation.

**User Interface:**
- **Interactive DataGridView**: Row selection and display of products for easy updates and deletions.
- **Bulk Operations**: Supports multi-row deletion with confirmation dialogs for safe data management.
- **Intuitive Layout**: User-friendly interface designed for efficient inventory operations.

**Security & Performance:**
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: Parameterized queries throughout the application for secure database access.
- **Data Validation**: Comprehensive client-side validation before database operations.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: Windows Forms (C#)
- **Backend**: ADO.NET with SqlClient
- **Database**: SQL Server LocalDB (Database1.mdf)
- **Framework**: .NET Framework 4.7.2
- **Data Access**: Parameterized queries for secure database operations

## Database Schema

The Products table includes:
- **ProductID**: Primary Key with auto-increment functionality
- **ProductName**: Name of the product
- **Quantity**: Stock quantity (integer)
- **Price**: Unit price (decimal)
- **Supplier**: Supplier information
- **OrderDate**: Date of order
- **TotalAmount**: Computed column (Quantity × Price) for inventory valuation

## Challenges and Learnings

Building this application taught me important lessons about database connectivity and parameterized queries. Implementing effective input validation required careful consideration of user experience while maintaining data integrity. The multi-criteria filtering feature demonstrated the importance of building flexible query logic that can handle various filter combinations.

Designing the database schema with a computed column for TotalAmount showed how to leverage database-level calculations for efficiency and consistency. The bulk operations feature with confirmation dialogs helped me understand the importance of user confirmation for destructive actions.

## Outcome

The Inventory Management System is a fully functional desktop application that successfully demonstrates core principles of database-driven development. It provides a complete solution for small to medium-sized businesses to manage their product inventory efficiently with a user-friendly interface and robust data protection mechanisms.

This project showcases proficiency in Windows Forms development, ADO.NET data access, SQL Server management, and building secure, user-centric applications with comprehensive data validation and integrity controls.
