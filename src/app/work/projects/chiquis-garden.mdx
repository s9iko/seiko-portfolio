## Challenges and Learnings

A major challenge was implementing a robust payment system with PayMongo, including webhook verification and a specialized background retry worker to handle payment failures. This significantly improved payment reliability and reduced transaction failure incidents. 

Building complex MongoDB schemas for inventory management, order processing, and customer data required careful planning and optimization. Implementing real-time features with Socket.IO for admin monitoring taught me about WebSocket handling, event emitting, and maintaining efficient socket connections.

Additionally, optimizing image delivery with Cloudinary and ensuring mobile responsiveness across diverse devices and connection speeds was valuable for understanding performance optimization and responsive design principles.

## Outcome

Chiqui's Garden is now a fully functional, production-ready e-commerce platform successfully serving customers. The platform handles real transactions, manages complex inventory, provides real-time admin monitoring, and delivers a smooth, engaging user experience. The implementation of a specialized payment retry worker significantly improved transaction reliability, demonstrating sophisticated problem-solving in production environments.

This capstone project showcases the ability to architect and implement a complete e-commerce solution from concept to production deployment, integrating multiple technologies and handling real-world business requirements at scale.
